# Bayesian-Network-MCMC
Using MCMC to find Pr(B|C=T) in a Bayesian Network

Given a Bayesian network, the markov blanket for each node was found to find the conditional probablitly of each node.
This was ran 10,000 times in order to see the convergence of the probablitly. Mine converged between .57-.58 most of the time, 
the actual convergence value is found to be .59 for our Bayes Net. The convergence could have been better if the program was
ran more times.
